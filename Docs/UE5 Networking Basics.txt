GameMode exists only on the server, authoritative rule set for game.

GameState exists on the server and is replicated to all clients. Contains replicated game data everyone should know.

PlayerState exists on the server and is replicated to all clients.
Contains replicated data about a specific player.

PlayerController exists on the server and on each player's machine. Clients do NOT have references to other client's PlayerControllers.

Setting Auto Possess Player to Player 0 is correct because each client's local player is always index 0. The server will handle remapping these indices.
Each client has their own local Player 0
Server has Player 0 (host), Player 1 (first client), Player 2 (second client), etc.
Client 1 sees: Local Player = Player 0
Client 2 sees: Local Player = Player 0
Server sees: Host = Player 0, Client 1 = Player 1, Client 2 = Player 2

Never use ServerTravel or ?listen on client, these are for the Server only.
