Unzip DevAuthTool:
For the GitHub version, to make the 'Launch DevTool' button function, go to YourProject\Plugins\EOSIntegrationKit\Source\ThirdParty\EIKSDK\Tools and extract EOS_DevAuthTool-win32-x64 to the same Tools folder using an unzipping tool like 7-Zip.

Set it to run at port 6300 and grant windows firewall access.
Login different epic game accounts, we need to give them names like this:
Context_1, Context_2, Context_3, etc. otherwise it WON'T work.

Under settings in EOS Integration Kit, we need to set:
Auto Login Type: Developer Tool
Fallback for Auto Login Type: None
Use EAS for Auto Login: enabled
Developer Tool Url: localhost:6300


DEPRECATED:
Another way to login would be (only works for 1 account):
In blueprints, if Get Login Status bool is false, then call:
Login using Auth Interface with these settings:

Credential Type: Developer
External Credential Type: Epic Games
Id: If you chose port 6300 and the Authentication Tool is running locally, Id should be "localhost:6300".
Token: should be the name you provided for the credential after logging into the Authentication Tool (Context_1).
